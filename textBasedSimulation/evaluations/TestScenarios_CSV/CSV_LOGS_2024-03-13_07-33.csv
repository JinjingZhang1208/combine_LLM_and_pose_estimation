I see you're having trouble with GPU errors when trying to run large language models. Have you considered using cloud-based services or distributed computing to overcome the GPU limitations? This could potentially help you with running the models without facing hardware constraints. What do you think about exploring such alternatives?",24.64,,,,0,0.0,0.4
